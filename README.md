### 01 - Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Interface
- Encapsulation and access modifiers
- Method overriding and runtime polymorphism
- Defining and using interfaces

### 02 - Data Structure - LinkedList
- Understanding linked list structure
- Implementing singly linked lists
- Basic operations: insertion, deletion, traversal


## Prerequisites
- Week 1 and Week 2 content familiarity (Java basics and OOP)
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- A code editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or Eclipse
